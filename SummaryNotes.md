## Evaluation Metrics for Regression Models (Simplified)

| Metric                  | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**      | The average amount the predictions are off from the true values, ignoring direction.          |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**       | The average of the squared differences between predictions and true values (penalizes big errors more). |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | The square root of MSE, showing error in the same units as the data.                         |
| **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** | The average error shown as a percentage of the true values.                                 |
| **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)** | How well the model explains the variation in the data (higher is better).                   |
| **Adjusted R-squared**              | Like R-squared but adjusts for extra variables to avoid overestimating performance.          |
