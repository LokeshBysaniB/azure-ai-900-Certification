## Evaluation Metrics for Regression Models (Simplified)

| Metric                  | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**      | The average amount the predictions are off from the true values, ignoring direction.          |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**       | The average of the squared differences between predictions and true values (penalizes big errors more). |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | The square root of MSE, showing error in the same units as the data.                         |
| **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** | The average error shown as a percentage of the true values.                                 |
| **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)** | How well the model explains the variation in the data (higher is better).                   |
| **Adjusted R-squared**              | Like R-squared but adjusts for extra variables to avoid overestimating performance.          |

### Natural Language Processing NLP
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) : Ability to identify different entities in a text and group them into a predefined set of classes
- Key Phase Extraction : Technique used to identify and extract the most important words or phrases from a piece of text.
- Sentiment Analysis : Determine the emotional tone or opinion expressed in a piece of text, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral

Imp Questions

1. Which assumption of the multiple linear regression model should be satisfied to avoid misleading predictions? - Features are independent of each other
2. **System messages** can used to identify constraints and styles for the responses of a generative AI model.
3. **Image description** is not supported by DALL E model
4. GPT model is good at creating and Understanding Natural Language
5. **Embeddings** can search, classify, and compare sources of text for similarity.
6. **Facial Detection** computer vision solution provides the ability to identify a person's age based on a photograph?
7. Which additional piece of information is included with each phrase returned by an image description task of the Azure AI Vision? **Confidence Score**
8. Face Identification - one to many mapping and Face verification one to one matching
9. Which natural language processing (NLP) technique normalizes words before counting them? **Stemming**
10. Which feature of the Azure AI Language service includes functionality that returns links to external websites to disambiguate terms identified in a text? **EntityRecognition**
11. Semantic segmentation provides the ability to classify individual pixels in an image depending on the object that they represent. The other answer choices also process images, but their outcomes are different.
- Stemming normalizes words before counting them. Frequency analysis counts how often a word appears in a text. N-grams extend frequency analysis to include multi-term phrases. Vectorization captures semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in n-dimensional space.
- Entity Linking identifies and disambiguates the identity of entities found in a text. Key phrase extraction is not used to extract entities and is used instead to extract key phrases to identify the main concepts in a text. Named entity recognition cannot provide a link for each entity to view further information. Text translation is part of the Azure AI Translator service.
- K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm component used for training clustering models. You can use unlabeled data with this algorithm. Linear regression and classification are supervised machine learning algorithm components. You need labeled data to use these algorithms. Normalize Data is not a machine learning algorithm module.

- Text Analytucs API : takes input text document and return sentiment and also helps with language detection and named entity recognition
- Direct Line channel to support speach ouput
- **Accuracy** is a calculated probability of correct Image classification.

  12 Best possible R2 score : Set primary metric to R2 score
  13. In the context of ROC curves, AUC values range from 0 to 1.

AUC = 1.0: Perfect model (always correct)

AUC = 0.5: Model is no better than random guessing

AUC < 0.5: Model is performing worse than random (systematically incorrect
